### Dear Reader, we are Team Gemera and we are happy to see you here!

This project is about web-site parcing related to the topic of Real Estates. 
And of all Real Estate related web-sites Krisha.kz turned out to be very lucky to be chosen as our first victim!

### Shortly about Krisha.kz

Krisha.kz is a specialized site about real estate in Kazakhstan. Here people who want to buy a roof (and with it walls, doors and windows) can meet with those who can offer all this to agree on mutually beneficial terms. In addition, on krisha.kz you can find a full range of construction, finishing, repair and other household services, contact specialists in housing law and insurance, find a good furniture store and learn about the latest news on the real estate market.

### Well, what is web-scraping?

Data scraping, also known as web-scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. Itâ€™s one of the most efficient ways to get data from the web, and in some cases to channel that data to another website.

### What kind of information we want to extract?

Before scraping the data we did a little survey among our friends, groupmates and some people we don't know too (probably our friends' groupmates or our groupmates' friends). 
This survey helped us to determine the main information about apartments - location, floor, room number etc.
You can see how web-site looks like below:

### Let us give you a little guide in our repository

parsing_data.ipynb - here you'll see the code we  made for data parcing and will find some comments and details.
analysis.ipynb - this thing will show how the parsed data were tortured in a different ways until it gave us the information we want.
